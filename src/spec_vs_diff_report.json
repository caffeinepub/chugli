  "summary": "The diff adds a developer-facing deployment diagnostics note explaining a frontend TypeScript build failure and applies React type-import fixes in three frontend components. However, it also includes additional changes (not clearly tied to the build/deploy failure) such as backend `main.mo` modifications and UI/behavior changes in a room delete dialog, which may be out of scope for the stated non-goals.",

    {
      "description": "Backend Motoko logic changes in `backend/main.mo` that are not evidenced as necessary to fix the frontend TypeScript build failure described in the diagnostics note.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest focuses on fixing the deployment/build failure; the added diagnostics identifies a frontend TS root cause, but the diff also modifies backend logic with no clear link to that stated root cause.",

    {
      "description": "Added/changed client-side admin password validation behavior in the room deletion dialog (password checked against `ADMIN_PASSWORD` before invoking the mutation).",
      "reason": "This appears to be a product behavior change (admin-delete flow logic) rather than a minimal change required to resolve a build/deploy failure; BuildRequest explicitly lists non-goals to avoid unrelated feature/behavior changes.",
